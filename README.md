# Booking Application

## Introduction

This is a simple cli application which books tickets. I created this project while learning the Go language.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the application with the command `git clone https://github.com/quamejnr/booking-app.git`.
2. From the project directory, you can run the application from your cli by running `go run main.go`.
